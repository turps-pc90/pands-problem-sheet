#### Task 2 - bank.py

Used the TutorialsPoint.com page (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-round-down-to-2-decimals-a-float-using-Python#:~:text=Use%20the%20ceil()%20function,and%20print%20the%20resultant%20number) to help with getting this task complete.
This program requests the user enter their fake account number. Assumption that accounts must be a minimum of 6 digits based on experience working in banking in the UK.

#### Task 3 - account.py

The safe_acc variable was informed by this Stack Overflow question - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40842451/how-do-i-use-the-replace-function-to-change-all-but-the-last-4-characters-of
This program requests the user enter their fake account number. I have assumed that accounts must be a minimum of 6 digits.

#### Task 4 - collatz.py

Used https://www.sanfoundry.com/python-program-test-collatz-conjecture-given-number/ to inform how to solve this task.
This program takes user input (a positive int) and outputs successive values.

#### Task 5 - weekday.py

Used https://stackoverflow.com/a/29384769/20182382 to help solve this.

#### Task 6 - squareroot.py

This program calcualtes the square root of an integer by using the Newton Square Root Formula and is based on the article found here -
https://tutorialsinhand.com/Articles/python-program-to-find-square-root-of-a-number-using-newton-square-root-formula.aspx#:~:text=If%20a%20given%20number%20is,correct%20square%20root%20of%20N.
while also learning from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55232484/newtons-method-for-approximating-square-roots and

This was a task I found much more difficult than the previous ones as the previous ones I could have a good solo attempt at due to previous projects I have done on Python for work.

#### Task 7 - es.py

This task initially threw me as I would normally associate tasks like these with Pandas as I would use it from reading CSV files from webscrapers I have built using Selenium. I selected Shakespeare texts as he was the first author that jumped out at me from Project Gutenburg however I have added those files to the .gitignore file as I was unsure if they were necessary for the upload of the task. I initially misread this task and provided a specific text but after re-reading the task, I saw the mention of a command line argument. 
I followed instructions from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-the-number-of-times-a-letter-appears-in-a-text-file-in-python/ to assist with completing the letter count aspect of this task however the menu was like one I had been working on recently for work where I am creating a command line menu in Python for the accounts department to select which payroll files they download via an API call. 

#### Task 8 - plottask.py

Weekly Task 8 - plottask.py - a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2 and a plot of the function h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 10], on the one set of axes
As well as the lecture videos. I researched this task by watching Corey Schafer's Youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDv6T4a0RNc) on Matplotlib Histograms, from GeeksForGeeks guide (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-normal-distribution-over-histogram-in-python/) and from W3 Schools Matplotlib notes - https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp
